### Specs
Built using Ruby in a Repl and Ruby 2.5.0

#### Gems:
- terminal-table
- rspec

### Setup

#### Local:
```bigquery
-- from root
bundle install
```

#### From Repl:
```bigquery
-- https://replit.com/@DandelionZA/Platform45-Mars-Rover
Just push the run button
```

### Tests
Tests are written in RSpec

To run tests
```bigquery
bundle exec rspec
```
### Assumptions

- I have assumed that the rover will never be given instructions that will make it go out of bounds.
